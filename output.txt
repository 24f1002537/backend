  "answer": "The question is explicitly asking whether to use gpt-4o-mini (which the AI Proxy supports) or gpt3.5 turbo. The context from the image and the surrounding text indicates that you should be using gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 as per the question requirements, even if the AI Proxy only supports gpt-4o-mini. This likely means you need to use the OpenAI API directly, not the AI Proxy, for this particular question. The tests section also specifies using openai:gpt-3.5-turbo.\n\nTherefore, even though the AI Proxy supports gpt-4o-mini, you should use gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 for this specific question.",
